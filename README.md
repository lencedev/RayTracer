#Raytracer

This project is a raytracer developed in C++ as part of the Epitech curriculum. The goal is to simulate the path of light rays to generate realistic images of 3D scenes, handling complex visual effects like reflections, refractions, and shadows.
Features

Rendering Pipeline: Efficiently simulates ray casting to project 3D objects onto a 2D screen.
Shadows and Lighting: Supports point lights and directional lights with accurate shadow casting.
Reflections and Refractions: Implements material properties to achieve realistic reflections and refractions.
Antialiasing: Reduces visual noise to produce smoother images.
Multithreading: Optimizes rendering time by utilizing multiple threads.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

To build and run this project, ensure you have:

C++17 or higher: Required for language features.
CMake: For building the project.
Make: For compilation.
SFML: Used for image display and manipulation (optional for rendering to a window).
